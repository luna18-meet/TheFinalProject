<h2 class="title"> About The Website</h2></header>
<div><p class="paragraph"> Think Like A Manager is basically a website where it mainly focuses on management in different aspects: time management, management in general, and the student council. <br>
Now you might ask yourself, what does the student council have to do with management? Well, as most of us might know, in every student council there is a president that is chosen by the students themselves. The council president should also be a manager and have some management skills so that the council would be a succsseful one.<br>
And still, you might ask yourself, why do we need to know about the student council, or management in general? Imagine living a life without having the ability to manage your day, and everything you do is just unorganized, what a mess that would be, am I right? <br>
On the other hand, managing your day, or even your life in a <b>correct way</b> is not easly done, it requires skills, smartness and sometimes experience. That is why this website is here for you! <br>
It provides you information for everything you need to know about management.<br>
We hope that this website will change your life for the better, let us know what you think in the comment section!
